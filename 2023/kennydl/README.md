# Advent of Code - 2023 ðŸŽ…

For this year of advent of code, have I taken the challenge of trying to solve the puzzles using GO. The main focus is to learn and explore more of GO.

## Requirements

You'll need the following tools to get started:

- [go version >= 1.21.4](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## Usage

```bash
$ go run . <days>

# For example
$ go run . 1 2 3 ...
```
