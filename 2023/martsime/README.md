# 2023 Advent of Code ðŸ¦€

This year I have chosen to solve the puzzles in rust once again, however new from this year is that the code is optimized purefully for performance.
If any humans stuble upon it, don't expect it to be very readable!

## Performance
```
Day        Part 1          Part 2
-----------------------------------
01        21.427Î¼s        32.875Î¼s
02        23.053Î¼s        27.102Î¼s
03        36.038Î¼s        28.183Î¼s
04        38.600Î¼s        39.313Î¼s
05        10.464Î¼s        66.755Î¼s

Total: 323.810Î¼s

## Requirements

To run the code you need a version of rust installed, preferably the newest, which is 1.74 at time of writing.

## Run the code

Run all puzzles already solved
```shell
cargo run --release
```

Run a specific puzzle
```shell
cargo run --release <day> <part>
```

For example
```shell
cargo run --release 1 1
```

## Tests
Test the solutions against the sample inputs given in the puzzle description
```shell
cargo test 
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmark the solutions using [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).
```shell
cargo bench
```
