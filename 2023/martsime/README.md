# 2023 Advent of Code ðŸ¦€

This year I have chosen to solve the puzzles in rust once again, however new from this year is that the code is optimized purefully for performance.
If any humans stuble upon it, don't expect it to be very readable!

## Performance
```
Day        Part 1          Part 2
-----------------------------------
01        19.832Î¼s        30.607Î¼s
02        23.088Î¼s        28.322Î¼s
03        36.416Î¼s        26.174Î¼s
04        38.063Î¼s        39.007Î¼s
05        10.449Î¼s        65.899Î¼s

## Requirements

To run the code you need a version of rust installed, preferably the newest, which is 1.74 at time of writing.

## Run the code

Run all puzzles already solved
```shell
cargo run --release
```

Run a specific puzzle
```shell
cargo run --release <day> <part>
```

For example
```shell
cargo run --release 1 1
```

## Tests
Test the solutions against the sample inputs given in the puzzle description
```shell
cargo test 
```

## Benchmarks

Benchmark the solutions using [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).
```shell
cargo bench
```
